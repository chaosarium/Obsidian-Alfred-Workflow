# Obsidian-Alfred-Workflow

An Alfred workflow for Obsidian that fits my need.

Inspired by: https://github.com/macedotavares/obsidian-utilities and https://github.com/hauselin/obsidian-alfred

Designed to be customisable and expandable.

Features:

- `o` to open your vault
- `o` + `⌘⏎` to open vault in [[VSCode]] (or your preferred editor)
- Any number of capture actions that appends something to a note, with a customisable template. For example:
	- `oi` to append an idea to an idea inbox and adds a timestamp
	- `os` to append an item to a shopping list and adds a `- [ ]` checkbox in front of it
- Any number of capture actions that appends something to a heading in a note, with a customisable template. For example:
	- `oj` to add a journal entry with a timestamp and the tag `#journal` under the `### Journal` heading in today's note
	- `ot` to add a task under the `### Inbox` heading in today's note
